# JOS
### Jacobs Operating System

JOS is a small operating that I am working on as an independant study, JOS is a pretty monolithic kernel (basic commands and
filesystems are compiled into the kernel) I do not believe this is the best approach, but this is my first real dive in to 
building an Operating System. 

Todo:
  - be able to list the contents of a file
  - be able to create and delete files 
  - build a unix-like file structure (/bin , /usr, /home etc)
  - start building userspace applications
     - improved shell
     - text editor
     - compiler (?)
  - OPTIMIZE
