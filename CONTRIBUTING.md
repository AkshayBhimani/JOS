## Contributing guidelines to JOS 

- Source Code files
  - When creating a new C file put all "#includes" in the header file
  - If using a struct declare it in the header file



- Naming Conventions
  - Variables are all lower case, words seperated by underscores
  - Functions are camel-case, the first letter of the function lower case, and the first letter of each word upper case
  - Structs are the same as functions
