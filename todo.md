# To Do

### Big Picture

- Files Api 
	- Create/Delete Files
	- Read/Write Files
	- Edit Files
- ~~Text Parser~~
- Scripting Language
- Stronger style enforcement


## Text Parsing
- Nothing to do :)


### Implentation of the text parser

- ~~Use the new parser with the shell.~~
- Use the new parser to create a prototype scripting language.
- A potential text parsing api specifically for files.

## keyboard
- Arrow Keys
- Caps Lock

## Shell
- Shutdown & Restart commands
- A better way to do functions 
	- perhaps have each function in a different folder?
