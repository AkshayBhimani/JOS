## To Do

### Big Picture

- Files Api 
	- Create/Delete Files
	- Read/Write Files
	- Edit Files
- ~~Text Parser~~
- Scripting Language
- Stronger style enforcement


### Text Parser

-  ~~Basic File parsing~~
- Bug where first character is always 'S' 
- Implementing with structs

### Implentation of the text parser

- ~~Use the new parser with the shell.~~
- Use the new parser to create a prototype scripting language.
- A potential text parsing api specifically for files.
